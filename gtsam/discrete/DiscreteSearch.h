/**
 * @brief DiscreteSearch: Search for the K best solutions.
 *
 * This class is used to search for the K best solutions in a DiscreteBayesNet.
 * This is implemented with a modified A* search algorithm that uses a priority
 * queue to manage the search nodes. That machinery is defined in the .cpp file.
 * The heuristic we use is the sum of the log-probabilities of the
 * maximum-probability assignments for each slot, for all slots to the right of
 * the current slot.
 *
 * TODO: The heuristic could be refined by using the partial assignment in
 * search node to refine the max-probability assignment for the remaining slots.
 * This would incur more computation but will lead to fewer expansions.

  /**
   * We structure the search as a set of slots, each with a factor and
   * a set of variable assignments that need to be chosen. In addition, each
   * slot has a heuristic associated with it.
   *
   * Example:
   * The factors in the search problem (always parents before descendents!):
   *    [P(A), P(B|A), P(C|A,B)]
   * The assignments for each factor.
   *    [[A0,A1], [B0,B1], [C0,C1,C2]]
   * A lower bound on the cost-to-go after each slot, e.g.,
   *    [-log(max_B P(B|A)) -log(max_C P(C|A,B)), -log(max_C P(C|A,B)), 0.0]
   * Note that these decrease as we move from right to left.
   * We keep the global lower bound as lowerBound_. In the example, it is:
   *    -log(max_B P(B|A)) -log(max_C P(C|A,B)) -log(max_C P(C|A,B))
